## Overview

This project connects **Apple TVs** and **Hue Bridges** under one roof:
- A simple **Flask** server hosts a web dashboard for pairing and configuration.
- A **system tray icon** (via [pystray](https://pypi.org/project/pystray/)) runs in the background, letting you right-click to “Launch Browser” or “Exit.”
- When your Apple TV changes state (Play, Pause, Stop), the Hue lights in that “room” automatically adjust brightness accordingly.

**Tested on Windows**, but should also work on macOS and Linux (with a desktop environment for the tray). For headless servers (e.g., Linux without a GUI), you can still use the Flask web UI, but the tray icon will not be visible.

---

## Features

- **Apple TV Control**: Pair with one or more Apple TVs to detect play/pause/stop states.
- **Hue Integration**: Configure your Hue Bridge, then define rooms with lighting presets.
- **Automated Lighting**: Lights brighten, dim, or turn off based on Apple TV activity.
- **Flask Dashboard**: Manage everything in your browser—no manual config needed.
- **System Tray**: Runs quietly in the background, freeing up your terminal.

---

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.7+**  
2. **Local Network**: Apple TVs and Hue Bridge must be on the same LAN as your computer.
3. **Graphical Desktop** (optional but recommended): For the tray icon to appear on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Installation

You can either **clone** this repository or **download the ZIP**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaker999/Apple-TV-Hue-Integration.git
cd Apple-TV-Hue-Integration
Or download the ZIP and extract it.

Run Setup
Find the location of the extracted file then open command prompt in Windows.
cd Apple-TV-Hue-Integration    "press enter"
python setup.py   "press enter"
If Python isn’t recognized, ensure it’s installed (3.7 or higher) and in your PATH.
During setup:

You’ll be prompted for a host IP (default: 127.0.0.1) and a port (default: 8888).
The script installs dependencies from requirements.txt.
It launches the Flask server in a detached process—no console needed.
Opens your default browser to http://<host>:<port>.
Closes its own setup console automatically.

Look for the system tray icon (Windows typically places new icons in the “hidden icons” area).
The web dashboard should be open in your browser. If not, manually visit http://<host>:<port>.


Future Launches
On Windows, the script creates a run.bat file for you to double-click next time.
On macOS/Linux, simply run python app.py & (or setup.py again, though setup is only needed once).

Usage
Windows
After the first install, find run.bat in the project folder.
Double-click run.bat:
Starts app.py in a console.
System tray icon appears near the clock.
Possibly opens the browser automatically (depending on how run.bat is configured).
Closing the console will kill the app if using python.

If you want it to keep running after you close the console, edit run.bat to use pythonw app.py or:

bat
Copy code
start pythonw app.py
start http://127.0.0.1:8888
exit
This approach lets you close the run.bat window without stopping the background process.

macOS & Linux
No .bat file is created here. Instead:

bash
Copy code
# Start the app
python app.py &

# or
nohup python app.py &
If you have a desktop environment, the tray icon should appear in the menubar (macOS) or system tray (e.g., GNOME/KDE on Linux).

On a headless Linux server, the tray icon won’t show (no GUI), but the Flask server still runs. Access it in your browser from any machine that can reach the server’s IP.
Configuration
config.json
Automatically generated by setup.py:

json
Copy code
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8888
}
host: the IP address your Flask server binds to.
port: the TCP port to listen on (default 8888).

requirements.txt

Lists your Python dependencies:

Flask
pyatv
phue
pystray
Pillow
…and possibly more. These are installed automatically when you run setup.py.
Troubleshooting
Tray Icon Missing
Check “hidden icons” on Windows or look for the menubar icon on macOS.
Ensure you’re running on a graphical desktop environment.

Closing the Console Kills the App (Windows)
By default, if you run python app.py in a standard console, closing it ends the process. Use pythonw.exe or DETACHED_PROCESS flags to keep it running after the console closes. The run.bat approach can be modified to start pythonw app.py.

Cannot Reach the Web Dashboard
Make sure the host in config.json is accessible (e.g., 0.0.0.0 if you want to connect from other devices). Disable or configure your firewall if needed.

No Logs
If you need real-time logs, run python app.py in a normal console to see output. For a background process, consider redirecting output to a file (e.g., nohup python app.py > app.log 2>&1 &).

Headless Linux
No tray icon is possible without a GUI. You can still use the web UI for all interactions.
